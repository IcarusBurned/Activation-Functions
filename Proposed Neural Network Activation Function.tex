\title{A Proposed Neural Network Activation Function}

\author{Matthew Schroeder}

\date{March 11, 2019}

\begin{abstract}
In this paper a new activation function for deep neural networks is presented.  Their are two variants of the activation function. The first is a smooth, oscillatory version of ReLU. The second is a smooth, oscillatory version of ReLU with exponential decay of the oscillations.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
The primary reason neural networks are so successful at solving problems in machine learning is their ability to create highly non-linear functions.   The feature of a neural network which makes this possible is the activation function.  The activation function takes what is otherwise a linear object and makes it non-linear.  It is no surprise then, that discovering new activation functions to use in neural networks is an ongoing area of research.   

The most popular activation function used today is the rectified linear unit (ReLU).  The most attractive property of ReLU seems to be its simplicity; the computation of this function and its derivative is very fast, which simplifies and accelerates the training of neural networks. ReLU, however, is not differentiable at the origin, which has lead to the search for other activation function which are differentiable at the origin and have similar properties.  The purpose of this paper is to present two such activation functions.    

The function which is the basis for the activation functions I will discuss is $$f(x) = \min(1, \max(0, x - \frac{1}{2\pi}\sin(2\pi x)))$$ In the past I have used this function to ramp a servo hydraulic actuator between points. It was chosen since it has continuous first and second derivatives and discontinuities in velocity or acceleration can damage some kinds of specimens (discontinuity in the jerk is tolerated).  A glance at the graph (fig. 1) reveals that this is a Sigmoid function and so, naturally, activation functions came to mind.

\label{Figure 1}
\end{figure}  

The goal of this paper is not to look at $x-\sin(x)$ as a replacement for the logistic function, but instead is to use $x-\sin(x)$ to create smooth versions of ReLU.   The two activation functions I will consider are shown in the Table 1.  The first is called Oscillating ReLU (OscReLU) )and the second Oscillating ReLU with Exponential Decay (DOscReLU). Both resolve the issue of non-differentiability at 0. 

\begin{table}[!h]
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.5}
\noindent\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
OscReLU & \max(0, x - \frac{1}{2\pi}\sin(2\pi x)\\
\hline
DOscReLU & \max(0, x - \frac{1}{2\pi}e^{-sx^2}\sin(2\pi x)\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
\end{table}

This paper is organized as follows.  In section 2, the new activation functions are discussed. Section 4 contains an analysis of experimental results.  Finally a conclusion is given in section 5.  

\section{OscReLU and DOscReLU}  





whose formula is given by $$f(x) = max(0,x)$$

\begin{lemma}
Let $f, g\in  A(X)$ and let $E$, $F$ be cozero
sets in $X$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $f$ is $E$-regular and $F\subseteq E$, then $f$ is $F$-regular.

\item If $f$ is $E$-regular and $F$-regular, then $f$ is $E\cup
F$-regular.

\item If $f(x)\ge c>0$ for all $x\in E$, then $f$ is $E$-regular.

\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

The following is an example of a proof.

\begin{proof} Set $j(\nu)=\max(I\backslash a(\nu))-1$. Then we have
\[
\sum_{i\notin a(\nu)}t_i\sim t_{j(\nu)+1}
  =\prod^{j(\nu)}_{j=0}(t_{j+1}/t_j).
\]
Hence we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\prod_\nu\biggl(\sum_{i\notin
  a(\nu)}t_i\biggr)^{\abs{a(\nu-1)}-\abs{a(\nu)}}
&\sim\prod_\nu\prod^{j(\nu)}_{j=0}
  (t_{j+1}/t_j)^{\abs{a(\nu-1)}-\abs{a(\nu)}}\\
&=\prod_{j\ge 0}(t_{j+1}/t_j)^{
  \sum_{j(\nu)\ge j}(\abs{a(\nu-1)}-\abs{a(\nu)})}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
By definition, we have $a(\nu(j))\supset c(j)$. Hence, $\abs{c(j)}=n-j$
implies (5.4). If $c(j)\notin a$, $a(\nu(j))c(j)$ and hence
we have (5.5).
\end{proof}

This is an example of an `extract'. The magnetization $M_0$ of the Ising
model is related to the local state probability $P(a):M_0=P(1)-P(-1)$.
The equivalences are shown in Table~\ref{eqtable}.

This is an example of a `definition' element.
For $f\in A(X)$, we define
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{Z} (f)=\{E\in Z[X]: \text{$f$ is $E^c$-regular}\}.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{Z} (f)=\{E\in Z[X]: \text{$f$ is $E^c$-regular}\}.
\end{equation}

The following is an example of a numbered list.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First item.
In the case where in $G$ there is a sequence of subgroups
\[
G = G_0, G_1, G_2, \dots, G_k = e
\]
such that each is an invariant subgroup of $G_i$.

\item Second item.
Its action on an arbitrary element $X = \lambda^\alpha X_\alpha$ has the
form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:action}
[e^\alpha X_\alpha, X] = e^\alpha \lambda^\beta
[X_\alpha X_\beta] = e^\alpha c^\gamma_{\alpha \beta}
 \lambda^\beta X_\gamma,
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item First subitem.
\[

\begin{enumerate}
\item First subsubitem.

\[
G = G_0, G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_k = e
\]
such that each subgroup $G_{i+1}$ is an invariant subgroup of $G_i$ and
each quotient group $G_{i+1}/G_{i}$ is abelian, the group $G$ is called
\textit{solvable}.

\item Second subsubitem.

normalization of $C$ hyperelliptic of genus $g-1\}$ of dimension $2g$;
\item $\mathcal{E}^2_{1,g-1}=\{$Pryms of double covers of
$C=\openbox^H_{P^1}$ with $H$ hyperelliptic of genus $g-2\}$ of
dimension $2g-1$;
\item $\mathcal{P}^2_{t,g-t}$ for $2\le t\le g/2=\{$Pryms of double
covers of $C=\openbox^{C'}_{C''}$ with $g(C')=t-1$ and $g(C'')=g-t-1\}$
of dimension $3g-4$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Zero case] $\rho(\Phi) = \{0\}$.

\item[Rational case] $\rho(\Phi) \ne \{0\}$ and $\rho(\Phi)$ is
contained in a line through $0$ with rational slope.
